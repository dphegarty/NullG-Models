"""Data models for Alpha Strike game system.

This module defines Pydantic models for the Alpha Strike fast-play variant
of Battletech. Alpha Strike simplifies the classic Battletech rules for
faster gameplay while maintaining tactical depth.

Alpha Strike uses simplified unit cards with consolidated damage values,
special abilities, and streamlined movement. These models represent the
data needed for Alpha Strike unit cards, including damage arcs for large
units, special abilities, and point values.
